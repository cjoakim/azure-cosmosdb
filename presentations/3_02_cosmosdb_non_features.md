# 3.02 - CosmosDB Non-Features

## CosmosDB does not implement these features

These are **relational concepts**.

- Schema
- Datatype Enforcement
- Identity Columns
- Joins to other Collections
- Referential Integrity
- Cascading Deletes
- Locking (OCC instead, with _etag)

Also, CosmosDB has a limited scope for **transactions**.
