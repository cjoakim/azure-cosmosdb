### CREATE TABLE example

```
use travel
```

```
CREATE TABLE travel.airports(
  "code"       text,
  "name"       text,
  "city"       text,
  "country"    text,
  "tz_name"    text,
  "tz_num"     int,
  "lat"        double,
  "lon"        double,
  "alt"        int,
  PRIMARY KEY (code)     <--- also the Partition Key
);
```

```
...
  PRIMARY KEY (name, city) <--- Alternative, a Compound Key and Partition Key
);
```

### CREATE TABLE and specify Throughput (RUs)

Defaults to 400 unless otherwise specified.

```
CREATE TABLE keyspaceName.tablename (user_id int PRIMARY KEY, lastname text)
    WITH cosmosdb_provisioned_throughput=1200
```

    DESCRIBE [cqlsh only]

    (DESC may be used as a shorthand.)

        Outputs information about the connected Cassandra cluster, or about
        the data objects stored in the cluster. Use in one of the following ways:

    DESCRIBE KEYSPACES

        Output the names of all keyspaces.

    DESCRIBE KEYSPACE [<keyspacename>]

        Output CQL commands that could be used to recreate the given keyspace,
        and the objects in it (such as tables, types, functions, etc.).
        In some cases, as the CQL interface matures, there will be some metadata
        about a keyspace that is not representable with CQL. That metadata will not be shown.

        The '<keyspacename>' argument may be omitted, in which case the current
        keyspace will be described.

    DESCRIBE TABLES

        Output the names of all tables in the current keyspace, or in all
        keyspaces if there is no current keyspace.

    DESCRIBE TABLE [<keyspace>.]<tablename>

        Output CQL commands that could be used to recreate the given table.
        In some cases, as above, there may be table metadata which is not
        representable and which will not be shown.

    DESCRIBE INDEX <indexname>

        Output the CQL command that could be used to recreate the given index.
        In some cases, there may be index metadata which is not representable
        and which will not be shown.

    DESCRIBE MATERIALIZED VIEW <viewname>

        Output the CQL command that could be used to recreate the given materialized view.
        In some cases, there may be materialized view metadata which is not representable
        and which will not be shown.

    DESCRIBE CLUSTER

        Output information about the connected Cassandra cluster, such as the
        cluster name, and the partitioner and snitch in use. When you are
        connected to a non-system keyspace, also shows endpoint-range
        ownership information for the Cassandra ring.

    DESCRIBE [FULL] SCHEMA

        Output CQL commands that could be used to recreate the entire (non-system) schema.
        Works as though "DESCRIBE KEYSPACE k" was invoked for each non-system keyspace
        k. Use DESCRIBE FULL SCHEMA to include the system keyspaces.

    DESCRIBE TYPES

        Output the names of all user-defined-types in the current keyspace, or in all
        keyspaces if there is no current keyspace.

    DESCRIBE TYPE [<keyspace>.]<type>

        Output the CQL command that could be used to recreate the given user-defined-type.

    DESCRIBE FUNCTIONS

        Output the names of all user-defined-functions in the current keyspace, or in all
        keyspaces if there is no current keyspace.

    DESCRIBE FUNCTION [<keyspace>.]<function>

        Output the CQL command that could be used to recreate the given user-defined-function.

    DESCRIBE AGGREGATES

        Output the names of all user-defined-aggregates in the current keyspace, or in all
        keyspaces if there is no current keyspace.

    DESCRIBE AGGREGATE [<keyspace>.]<aggregate>

        Output the CQL command that could be used to recreate the given user-defined-aggregate.

    DESCRIBE <objname>

        Output CQL commands that could be used to recreate the entire object schema,
        where object can be either a keyspace or a table or an index or a materialized
        view (in this order).
