## Definition

> A NoSQL (originally referring to "non-SQL" or "non-relational") database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases(1).

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL

(1) = my footnote, after 1990 and Dr. E.F. Codd

Others models pre-dated Relational, such as hierarchical [IMS](https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/z/ims)

## 

Think of relational databases as the narrow (i.e. - ANSI standard) but dense band of 
wavelengths that is visible light.  NoSQL is all the other wavelengths.
