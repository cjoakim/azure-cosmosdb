# 3.06 - SQL

The **SQL query syntax** is easy to use and has a minimal learning curve.

It works as you expect it to.

## Examples

See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql-query-getting-started

```
SELECT *
FROM Families f
WHERE f.id = "AndersenFamily"
```

```
SELECT food.id,
       food.description,
       food.tags,
       food.foodGroup,
       food.version
FROM   food
WHERE  food.foodGroup IN ("Poultry Products", "Sausages and Luncheon Meats")
  AND (food.id BETWEEN "05740" AND "07050")
```

#### Reformat the JSON output into a different shape

```
SELECT {"Name":f.id, "City":f.address.city} AS Family
    FROM Families f
    WHERE f.address.city = f.address.state

Returns:

[
    {
        "Family": {
            "Name": "WakefieldFamily",
            "City": "NY"
        }
    }
]
```

#### Self Joins

```
SELECT c.givenName
FROM Families f
JOIN c IN f.children
WHERE f.id = 'WakefieldFamily'
ORDER BY f.address.city ASC
```

## What about other SQL commands like DELETE, CREATE TABLE, etc?

The SQL syntax is for **SELECT queries**.  For other operations use a SDK, Automation, REST.
